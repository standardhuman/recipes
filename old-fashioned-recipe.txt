Ingredients
1 sugar cube
3 dashes of bitters
2 teaspoons water
1 strip lemon zest
1 small wedge orange
2 maraschino cherries
Ice, as needed
2 ounces bourbon
Club soda
Cherry for garnish
Directions
Add the sugar cube, bitters, water, lemon zest, orange wedge and cherry to the bottom of an old fashioned glass. Use a small spoon to muddle the cube into the liquids so the sugar will begin to dissolve.

Add ice to the glass and top with bourbon and club soda and stir well. Top with a cherry.
